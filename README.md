⚠️ This repository is a work in progress!

The main task of this project is to reproduce the results of the paper "Clustering Market Regimes using the Wasserstein Distance" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11848). The focus of this paper is to use the p-Wasserstein distance to detect different regimes in the market. The central point is to modify the classical k-means clustering algorithm in order to group a family of empirical probability measures.
In addition, I tried to come up with a different idea:
- detect market regimes by adjusting the classical Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering;

In this repository, I shared the code for the synthetic price path.

SLIDES:
so far, only theoretical notions are included in the slides. I will also add the results obtained from simulations.
